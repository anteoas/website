We may also share personal information with public authorities where there is a legal obligation to do so.

Information stored in accordance with legal obligations will be deleted when the obligation ceases. For instance, we have retention obligations according to accounting legislation. Furthermore, accounting legislation requires us to store certain accounting documents for a specified period, typically 3.5 years or 5 years. Information shared by job applicants who did not get the job, including information provided in CVs and applications, will be deleted unless we have obtained consent for further storage.

However, this does not apply if the processing is necessary to fulfill an agreement you have entered into with us or if you have previously given your explicit consent to the processing.

You also have the right to receive a copy of the personal data we have registered about you, as long as confidentiality does not prevent this. To ensure that personal data is disclosed to the correct person, we may require requests for access to be made in writing and that identity be verified in another way.
