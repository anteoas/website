Anteo Kartverktøy is an advanced mapping solution tailored for aquaculture, combining geographic information with real-time data for optimal operations.
The system offers five core functions: interactive maps updated with live data, vessel tracking and route planning, integrated weather and wave alerts, detailed site and facility information, and historical data with trend analyses for improved decision making.

Benefits include better operational planning through centralized information, enhanced safety with real-time weather updates, optimized transport routes saving time and fuel, and reduced operational costs through more efficient resource use and fewer unforeseen events.
