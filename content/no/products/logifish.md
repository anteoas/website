Logifish is a complete digital solution for fish transport, ensuring full control and traceability throughout the transport chain. The system includes five core functions: digital transport documentation, end-to-end traceability, continuous temperature logging, systematic biosecurity checks, and direct integration with regulatory reporting.

Logifish prioritizes safety and traceability by storing full transport histories, monitoring critical parameters in real time, and sending automatic alerts for any deviations. All activities, from loading to unloading, are logged in detail. Benefits include compliance with regulations, reduced human error through digital automation, time and resource savings, and enhanced biosecurity that protects fish health for both transporters and producers.
