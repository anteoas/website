This project uses shared planning documents for collaboration with Claude Code. Please:

	1. First read and understand these files:
	   - llm/PLAN.md - current project roadmap and objectives
	   - llm/ARCHITECTURE.md - technical decisions and system design
	   - llm/TODO.md - current tasks and their status
	   - llm/DECISIONS.md - decision history with rationale
	   - llm/WORKFLOW.md - how we work

	2. Before making any significant changes, check these documents for:
	   - Existing architectural decisions
	   - Current priorities
	   - Tasks already in progress
	   - Previous context from Claude Code

	3. After completing work, update the relevant planning documents with:
	   - Run test suite
	   - Task completion status
	   - New decisions made
	   - Any changes to architecture or approach

	Always treat these files as the single source of truth for project state.
